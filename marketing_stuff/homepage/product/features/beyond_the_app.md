# Beyond the App: Extending the Value of Asemic

Asemic is more than just a powerful product analytics solution — it’s a platform designed to seamlessly handle complex changes in your data model while ensuring that your data remains organized and ready for use in any analysis, even outside the app. By automating the heavy lifting involved in managing evolving user data, Asemic reduces operational overhead and enables faster, deeper insights across your organization.

## Automated Handling of Complex Data Model Changes

In a fast-paced product environment, user data models constantly evolve. New properties are added, old ones are deprecated, and transformations need to be updated to keep analyses relevant. Asemic automates these complex changes with minimal disruption:

- __Adding New Properties__: When new properties are introduced, Asemic’s Semantic Layer automatically integrates them into the data model. These properties become immediately available for use in segments, metrics, and custom queries.
- __Managing Transformations__: Writing transformations for calculating properties and updating them as the data model evolves is fully automated, reducing the need for manual intervention by your team.
- __Rewinding and Recalculating__: Asemic can backfill and recalculate historical data whenever changes occur, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all metrics and analyses.

By taking care of these intricate processes behind the scenes, Asemic allows your team to stay focused on extracting insights rather than worrying about data maintenance.

## A Well-Organized Data Structure, Ready for External Use

Beyond the built-in analytics and features within Asemic, the platform exposes a clean and well-organized data structure that’s directly accessible for querying. Whether you’re using another BI tool or doing deep analysis in Python notebook, Asemic provides analysts with an intuitive, structured view of the data, speeding up advanced analyses outside of the app.

This capability is especially valuable for teams that need to:

- __Perform Deep Custom Analysis__: Analysts can leverage the data structure for advanced analyses that require more tailored approaches than what’s possible within standard analytics tools.
- __Integrate with Other BI Tools__: Asemic’s organized data structure can be seamlessly connected to your existing BI stack, providing continuity in workflows and ensuring data integrity across all tools.
