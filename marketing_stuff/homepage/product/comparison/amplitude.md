# Asemic vs Amplitude (Mixpanel, Heap etc)

## Take Control of Your Data and Experience the Full Potential of Warehouse-Native Product Analytics

Problems:

1. Cost
2. Black box vs free data access
3. Data consistency - zero copy policy


### 1. Runaway Costs: Scaling Becomes Expensive

Most analytics tools start off feeling budget-friendly, but costs quickly spiral out of control as your tracked user base expands. For B2C and freemium businesses, this is particularly challenging—you’re forced to pay premium prices to monitor non-paying users. You shouldn’t have to compromise your insights just because you’re scaling.

### 2. Opaque Data Access: The ‘Black Box’ Dilemma

Analytics platforms like Amplitude are powerful, but they can also feel like a black box. When you need to push the boundaries and dig deeper, you’re often left stuck. Fragmented data workflows become unmanageable over time, eroding trust in both the data and the results your teams depend on. Free, consistent access to your raw data should be the standard, not a costly luxury.

### 3. Limited Flexibility: No Room for Post-Processing

With Amplitude’s event-based tracking, there’s little room for post-processing, which means limited flexibility. Want to dive deeper or explore new analysis paths? You’re often stuck waiting for weeks until new release cycles introduce the tracking updates you need. Your teams deserve to move faster, iterate quickly, and analyze on their terms—not on the platform’s schedule.

## Why Going Warehouse-Native Matters?

1. Cost Efficient
2. Own Your Data
3. Unparalleled Flexibility


### 1. Cost Efficient

A data warehouse-native approach allows you to leverage the infrastructure you already pay for, instead of relying on a separate analytics tool that scales unpredictably in cost. As your data needs grow, your expenses remain controlled and predictable. But that’s not where the savings stop. Asemic’s custom-built Query Engine is designed by top experts with advanced optimizations at the data model and query structure level. Using Asemic will not only reduce your data warehouse costs but also free up your analysts’ time, allowing them to focus on high-impact work instead of constantly writing SQL.


### 2. Own Your Data

Your data is your greatest asset when you fully own and control it in your data warehouse. This ownership unlocks maximum value, whether you’re building specialized data products or uncovering deeper insights. Asemic provides top-tier product analytics, giving you the freedom to focus on driving more value from your data without compromise.


### 3. Unparalleled Flexibility

A warehouse-native approach offers unmatched flexibility, letting you work with your data on your own terms. Whether you’re performing real-time analytics, applying custom transformations, or integrating machine learning outputs, your data warehouse handles it all. Asemic enhances this flexibility by seamlessly incorporating transformed data, whether it’s generated via SQL or an ML system, giving you total freedom to explore and act on your data with no delays or roadblocks.
