# Cohort Analysis with Asemic

Asemic's Cohort Analysis feature offers powerful insights by tracking how user behavior evolves over time. With Asemic, you can easily define metrics and use them across day-to-day tracking, cohort analysis, and more advanced metrics, all within a flexible and intuitive framework.

## More than Retention and LTV

One of the standout aspects of Asemic is that metrics defined for daily tracking are often ready to be applied directly in cohort analysis. For instance, you may already track the number of sessions per day — a metric that remains consistent and predictable over time. But what happens when you view that same metric for users who have just registered, users a week after registration, or even a month later? With Asemic, you can effortlessly analyze this and any other key metrics to see how behavior changes as users progress through their journey.

This approach makes it easy to answer questions like: Are new users more engaged during their first few days compared to long-term users? Which metrics see the biggest drop-off over time? By taking metrics you’re already familiar with and applying them to cohorts, you gain a richer understanding of user retention, engagement patterns, and the effectiveness of your strategies.

## Lifetime User Properties for Deeper Cohort Metrics

Asemic’s Semantic Layer allows for simple, yet powerful, definitions of lifetime User Properties. You can easily track cumulative metrics like total revenue per user, the total number of active days in the app, or other long-term behaviors. These lifetime properties can then be seamlessly incorporated into cohort analysis, enabling advanced metrics that are difficult or even impossible to construct in other product analytics tools.

## Discovering Behavioral Changes Over Time

The true power of cohort analysis lies in understa	nding how user behavior evolves. Asemic’s segmentation and KPI tools help you identify patterns that may not be immediately visible through standard day-to-day tracking. Are users highly engaged in their first week and then taper off? Do they return consistently after long periods of inactivity? Asemic makes it easy to uncover these patterns and respond proactively.

The flexibility of Asemic’s Semantic Layer means you can quickly define and analyze a wide variety of cohort metrics, whether you’re focused on user retention, engagement, monetization, or any other aspect of behavior over time. The insights you gain can drive strategic decisions, helping your team focus on improving the right areas for long-term success.

## Empowering Product and Marketing Teams with Cohort Insights

Deeper analysis of cohort behavior can offer valuable insights to both product and marketing teams. Product teams can use cohort analysis to identify which features drive long-term engagement and which moments are critical for retaining users. Marketing teams, on the other hand, can track how different campaigns impact various cohorts over time—seeing which messages resonate with new users versus existing users. By understanding how behavior shifts across user segments, both teams can refine their strategies to better meet user needs and drive growth.


--- 
With Asemic, cohort analysis becomes a natural extension of your existing analytics, allowing you to explore how user behavior changes over time with minimal additional setup. The ability to define lifetime User Properties and use KPIs across multiple contexts ensures that your analysis is both comprehensive and adaptable. Whether you're fine-tuning your onboarding process or tracking the long-term impact of a new feature, Asemic provides the tools you need to dig deeper and make informed decisions that drive growth.
