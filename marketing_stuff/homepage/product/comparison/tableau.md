# Asemic vs Tableau (Power BI, Superset, etc)

## Stop Wrestling with Dashboards. Get Straight to the Answers with Warehouse-Native Product Analytics.

Problems:

1. Easy Business Questions are Hard to answer
2. Broken Feedback Loop
3. Too many Dashboards

### 1. Easy Business Questions Are Hard to Answer

Traditional BI tools like Tableau are built primarily for visualizing data, not for answering business questions
directly. These tools rely on fixed data sources, forcing you to pre-define every potential slice of data. As a result,
what should be a simple query often turns into a complex data modeling task. Analysts must constantly rework datasets to
accommodate follow-up questions, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment between business needs and available
insights.

### 2. The Broken Feedback Loop

Tableau isn’t designed for the average business user, yet they’re the ones who need quick answers to make informed
decisions. This creates an overwhelming flow of ad-hoc requests that swamp analytics teams, causing frustration on both
sides. Business users wait days for essential insights, while analysts struggle to keep up with the never-ending
backlog, leaving little room for proactive work.

### 3. Too Many Dashboards, Not Enough Answers

In traditional BI setups, dashboards are king, but they’re built for monitoring a fixed set of variables. Modern
businesses need flexibility—they need to answer new questions and explore data from fresh perspectives. This often leads
to an explosion of dashboards, leaving users confused about where to find answers. Underneath the surface, the number of
data models grows just as fast, demanding constant maintenance or risking broken dashboards across the board.

## Why Using Warehouse-Native Product Analytics Matters?

1. Asemic understands your data
2. Empowers business users and analysts
3. Ubiqutos data model

### 1. Asemic Understands Your Data

Unlike traditional BI tools, Asemic is purpose-built for user-generated behavior data. It understands key concepts like
Users, Events, and KPIs, providing a more intuitive framework for analysis. Instead of connecting to rigid tables or
views, Asemic leverages a dynamic data model that adapts to your evolving questions. No more endless tables—just
flexible, intelligent insights.

Check the [Semantic Layer](../features/semantic_layer.md) that enables deep understanding of user data.

### 2. Fix the Feedback Loop

With Asemic, analysts define metrics, user properties, and events that act as modular building blocks for business
users. These components are easily combined, allowing users to get answers instantly without needing deep technical
knowledge. The risk of user errors is drastically reduced, as they work with well-defined metrics rather than raw data.
Analysts remain in control of the definitions, ensuring consistency across the organization.

Check [Composability in Asemic](../features/composability.md) for more information about fitting the building blocks
together.

### 3. Answers Over Dashboards

In Asemic, dashboards are a means to an end, not the end itself. Thanks to our smart Layout Engine and well-defined
objects, you can build a dashboard in 10 minutes—a task that could take a day in Tableau. This speed shifts the focus
from static dashboards to dynamic exploration. Dive into your data, share insights, scrap what’s irrelevant, and pivot
to new perspectives, all in real-time—even mid-meeting.

Check [Layout Engine](../features/layout_engine.md) for more information on how it helps you make the perfect dashboard
fast.
