## Best Practices for Dashboard Creation

1. **Start with a clear goal**: Define what questions your dashboard should answer before you start building.

2. **Use a logical layout**: Arrange your visualizations in a way that tells a coherent story.

3. **Limit the number of visualizations**: Aim for 5-7 visualizations per dashboard to avoid overwhelming viewers.

4. **Use consistent formatting**: Stick to a consistent color scheme and chart types for a professional look.

5. **Provide context**: Use text boxes to explain complex metrics or provide additional context for your data.

6. **Update regularly**: Set up automated refresh schedules to keep your dashboard data up-to-date.

7. **Iterate based on feedback**: Regularly ask for feedback from dashboard users and make improvements accordingly.

## Advanced Features

- **Dashboard Templates**: Save your dashboard as a template for quick reuse across different data sets or teams.
- **Dynamic Date Ranges**: Use relative date ranges to create dashboards that automatically update to show the most recent data.
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Set up drill-down links between dashboards for deeper analysis.
