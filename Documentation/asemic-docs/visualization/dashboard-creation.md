## Dashboards

Asemic is not a dashboarding tool. Dashboards are just a format for communicating data, but in Asemic the first class citizens are metrics and other elements defined in Semantic Layer. Dashboard is a container within which we can easily recombine these building blocks for various purposes.

1. **Ad-hoc data requests**: Business often needs value of a metric for a specific segment. Just go to KPI explorer, pick a metric or more and define your segment(s). You don't have to save this, it's a minute of work to get it and it is always available.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Asemic allows building highly complex analysis out of the box and supports large number of Charts. Put 100s of charts with various segments to give yourself multiple perspectives on data. Once you satisfy your curiosity, build a proper dashboard for sharing with other people.

3. **Operational Dashboard**: There a business units that require a fixed set of metrics with the ability to change the view by tinkering with available filters. In Asemic the line between creating a dashboard and interacting with one is blurred. This enables much greater flexibilty in interacting with a dashboard.

Remember, the most effective dashboards are those that provide clear, actionable insights at a glance. Take the time to refine your dashboards and ensure they're meeting the needs of your team.
