# Asemic Segmentation

Asemic's Segmentation feature offers robust capabilities for crafting dynamic user segments based on events, sequences, or User Properties. It’s designed for a range of use cases—from ad-hoc data exploration to maintaining reliable segments in BI tools and dashboards.

## Flexibility for Deep Data Exploration

Asemic offers infinite flexibility when defining segments by leveraging user events and event sequences. This is ideal for analysts who need to explore the nuances of user behavior and interactions. Sequences make it easy to segment users based on complex behaviors, like those who engaged with a series of actions leading up to a purchase. Analysts gain access to both event-based and property-based segmentations, enabling deeper insights and granular control.

## User Properties for Fast, Stable Segments

For business users focused on well-defined reports and dashboards, segmentation through User Properties offers speed and reliability. User Properties are pre-aggregated on a daily level, making them perfect for recurring analyses and BI workflows. This allows users to quickly create segments based on predefined metrics like “high-value users” or “active in the last 7 days.”

## Time-Traveling Insights: Analyze User History Over Any Time Frame

One of Asemic’s standout features is its ability to track the complete history of user behavior, letting you segment users not only based on their current state but also on their past actions and statuses. You can see how users who interacted with a Black Friday offer behaved before, during, and after the promotion. Or, it’s possible to track users marked as high-value (whales) a week ago but have since downgraded, revealing how trends shift over time.
This capability lets you analyze user behavior at different stages, understand trends, and respond proactively to changing dynamics.

## Smooth Learning Curve with Depth for Advanced Use

Asemic offers an intuitive user experience, helping business users define segments quickly using well-defined properties without diving into complex technical details. For analysts and those with more advanced needs, the tool also supports event sequences and properties based on past or future data, offering almost limitless possibilities in segmentation strategy. The combination of ease of use for business users and depth for analysts ensures that teams can grow into the platform’s full capabilities over time.
