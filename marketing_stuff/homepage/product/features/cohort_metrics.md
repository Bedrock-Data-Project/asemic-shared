# Cohort Analysis with Asemic

Asemic's Cohort Analysis feature offers powerful insights by tracking how user behavior evolves over time. With Asemic,
you can easily define metrics and use them across day-to-day tracking, cohort analysis, and more advanced metrics, all
within a flexible and intuitive framework.

## More than Retention and LTV

One of the standout aspects of Asemic is that metrics defined for daily tracking are often ready to be applied directly
in cohort analysis. For instance, you may already track the number of sessions per day — a metric that remains
consistent and predictable over time. But what happens when you view that same metric for users who have just
registered, users a week after registration, or even a month later? With Asemic, you can effortlessly analyze this and
any other key metrics to see how behavior changes as users progress through their journey.

This approach makes it easy to answer questions like: Are new users more engaged during their first few days compared to
long-term users? Which metrics see the biggest drop-off over time? By taking metrics you’re already familiar with and
applying them to cohorts, you gain a richer understanding of user retention, engagement patterns, and the effectiveness
of your strategies.

## Lifetime User Properties for Deeper Cohort Metrics

Asemic’s Semantic Layer allows for simple, yet powerful, definitions of lifetime User Properties. You can easily track
cumulative metrics like total revenue per user, the total number of active days in the app, or other long-term
behaviors. These lifetime properties can then be seamlessly incorporated into cohort analysis, enabling advanced metrics
that are difficult or even impossible to construct in other product analytics tools.

## Discovering Behavioral Changes Over Time

The true power of cohort analysis lies in understa nding how user behavior evolves. Asemic’s segmentation and KPI tools
help you identify patterns that may not be immediately visible through standard day-to-day tracking. Are users highly
engaged in their first week and then taper off? Do they return consistently after long periods of inactivity? Asemic
makes it easy to uncover these patterns and respond proactively.

The flexibility of Asemic’s Semantic Layer means you can quickly define and analyze a wide variety of cohort metrics,
whether you’re focused on user retention, engagement, monetization, or any other aspect of behavior over time. The
insights you gain can drive strategic decisions, helping your team focus on improving the right areas for long-term
success.

## Empowering Product and Marketing Teams with Cohort Insights

Deeper analysis of cohort behavior can offer valuable insights to both product and marketing teams. Product teams can
use cohort analysis to identify which features drive long-term engagement and which moments are critical for retaining
users. Marketing teams, on the other hand, can track how different campaigns impact various cohorts over time—seeing
which messages resonate with new users versus existing users. By understanding how behavior shifts across user segments,
both teams can refine their strategies to better meet user needs and drive growth.


--- 
With Asemic, cohort analysis becomes a natural extension of your existing analytics, allowing you to explore how user
behavior changes over time with minimal additional setup. The ability to define lifetime User Properties and use KPIs
across multiple contexts ensures that your analysis is both comprehensive and adaptable. Whether you're fine-tuning your
onboarding process or tracking the long-term impact of a new feature, Asemic provides the tools you need to dig deeper
and make informed decisions that drive growth.
