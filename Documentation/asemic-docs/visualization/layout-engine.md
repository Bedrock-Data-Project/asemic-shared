# Asemic Layout Engine

Asemic's Layout Engine is an intelligent system that automatically selects and configures the most appropriate visualizations for your data. This guide explains how the Layout Engine works and how you can interact with it to create optimal visualizations.

## How the Layout Engine Works

The Layout Engine considers several factors when deciding how to visualize your data:

1. **Data Type**: The nature of your data (e.g., categorical, numerical, time-series)
2. **Number of Dimensions**: How many different attributes you're trying to visualize
3. **Data Distribution**: The statistical properties of your data
4. **User Intent**: The type of analysis you're performing (e.g., comparison, trend analysis, distribution)
5. **Chart Size**: The available space for the visualization
6. **User Preferences**: Any saved preferences or common choices in your organization

Based on these factors, the Layout Engine selects the most appropriate chart type and configures its settings.

## Supported Chart Types

The Layout Engine can select from a variety of chart types, including:

- Line Charts
- Bar Charts
- Scatter Plots
- Pie Charts
- Heatmaps
- Box Plots
- Funnel Charts
- Sankey Diagrams

## Example: Automatic Chart Selection

When you select a KPI and dimensions for analysis, the Layout Engine automatically chooses an appropriate visualization. For instance:

- Single KPI over time → Line Chart
- KPI comparison across categories → Bar Chart
- Two KPIs correlation → Scatter Plot
- Parts of a whole → Pie Chart

## Overriding Layout Engine Suggestions

While the Layout Engine provides intelligent suggestions, you can always override its choices:

1. Click on the chart type icon in the top-right corner of your visualization
2. Select your preferred chart type from the dropdown menu
3. Use the configuration panel to adjust chart settings

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Defaults

The Layout Engine adapts its suggestions based on the context of your analysis:

- For funnel analysis, it might default to a funnel chart or a specialized sankey diagram
- For cohort analysis, it might suggest a heatmap view

### Adaptive Layout

The Layout Engine can adjust chart layouts based on available space:

- In dashboards, it might use more compact visualizations
- In full-screen mode, it might add more detail or interactivity

### Multi-Chart Layouts

For complex analyses, the Layout Engine can suggest multi-chart layouts:

- Combining a main chart with supporting visualizations
- Creating small multiples for easy comparison across dimensions

## Best Practices

1. **Trust but Verify**: The Layout Engine is highly accurate, but always review its suggestions to ensure they align with your analytical goals.

2. **Experiment with Options**: Even if the suggested visualization looks good, try other options to see if they provide additional insights.

3. **Consider Your Audience**: While a complex visualization might be insightful, simpler charts are often better for general audiences.

4. **Use Consistent Layouts**: For recurring reports or dashboards, maintain consistent chart types for easier comparison over time.

5. **Leverage Interactivity**: Many of Asemic's charts offer interactive features like drill-downs or tooltips. Use these to add depth to your visualizations without cluttering the main view.

## Customizing Layout Engine Behavior

Advanced users can customize the Layout Engine's behavior:

```yaml
layout_engine_settings:
  default_chart_type:
    time_series: area_chart
  color_scheme: custom_brand_colors
  prefer_horizontal_bars: true
```

These settings can be applied org-wide or on a per-user basis.

## Conclusion

Asemic's Layout Engine takes the guesswork out of creating effective data visualizations. By automatically selecting and configuring charts, it allows you to focus on interpreting your data rather than struggling with visualization tools. However, it also provides the flexibility for you to take control when you need to create custom or specialized visualizations.
