# Simple and Fast Data Integration with Asemic

Asemic makes it quick and straightforward to connect your product data, thanks to its powerful Semantic Layer. Whether your event data is stored across multiple tables or within a single table, Asemic’s integration process is designed to get you up and running in record time. From registering your data to creating new metrics, Asemic ensures that your team can start extracting value within days, not weeks.

## Seamless Integration Through the Semantic Layer

At the core of Asemic’s integration process is the Semantic Layer, which abstracts away much of the complexity associated with introducing a new tool. The first step is to register your event data with Asemic’s User Action Catalog. Whether your data is organized in multiple event tables or consolidated in one large table, the Semantic Layer standardizes and organizes it into a structure optimized for analysis. Once the event data is registered, basic set of metrics are automatically generated and ready for use.

This streamlined process minimizes the need for custom data modeling or complex transformations, ensuring that your data is accessible and actionable as quickly as possible.

## Immediate Availability of Metrics

Adding new metrics is also straightforward and streamlined. When a new metric is defined, it’s immediately available for querying, empowering your team to iterate quickly on dashboards and reports. The only exception is lifetime metrics, which require a one-time recalculation before becoming fully available. However, even this process is automated and designed for speed.
