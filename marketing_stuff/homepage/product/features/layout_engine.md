# Layout Engine: Smarter Visualization for Faster Insights

## Get the Right Chart, Instantly

In traditional analytics tools, creating a clear and meaningful chart often requires extensive tweaking. With Asemic’s
Layout Engine, this process is automated. The Layout Engine intelligently selects the best chart settings based on the
context of your selected KPIs, segments, groups, time periods, and other variables. No more guesswork or endless
adjustments—just instant, actionable insights.

## How the Layout Engine Works

Asemic’s Layout Engine considers multiple factors when deciding how to visualize your data, including:

- __Selected KPI(s)__: The engine understands what type of chart best represents the selected metric—whether it’s a line
  chart for trends, a bar chart for comparisons, or something more complex.
- __Number of Segments and Groups__: The Layout Engine adjusts the chart type and layout based on how many segments or
  groups you’re analyzing, ensuring that the visualization remains clear and interpretable.
- __Time Period__: Whether you’re looking at daily, weekly, or yearly data, the engine adapts the time axis and overall
  layout accordingly.
- __Chart Size__: The Layout Engine optimizes settings like axis labels, gridlines, and data density based on the
  available space, ensuring your charts are both informative and easy to read.

## Context-Aware Defaults for Rapid Analysis

The Layout Engine is built with context in mind. For instance, when analyzing a KPI with multiple segments over a short
time frame, it might default to a stacked bar chart for better visual clarity. For more granular time-series data, it
might choose a line chart with smoothed curves and optimized axis scaling.

By automatically selecting the best settings, Asemic empowers you to focus on interpreting your data—not formatting it.

## Customization Without Complexity

While the Layout Engine provides optimal defaults, it doesn’t lock you in. You can easily adjust any chart settings
manually to fit specific needs or preferences. The engine’s intelligent recommendations get you 90% of the way there,
while still allowing for full customization when necessary.

## Why It Matters

In data analytics, time is of the essence. The Layout Engine reduces the friction in creating meaningful visualizations,
so you can spend more time analyzing and less time tinkering with settings. Whether you’re building dashboards or
running ad-hoc analysis, the Layout Engine ensures your charts are always optimized for clarity, relevance, and impact.
