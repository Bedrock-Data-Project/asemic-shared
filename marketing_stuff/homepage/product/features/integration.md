# Simple and Fast Data Integration with Asemic

Asemic makes it quick and straightforward to connect your product data, thanks to its powerful Semantic Layer. Whether
your event data is stored across multiple tables or within a single table, Asemic’s integration process is designed to
get you up and running in record time. From registering your data to creating new metrics, Asemic ensures that your team
can start extracting value within days, not weeks.

## Seamless Integration Through the Semantic Layer

At the core of Asemic’s integration process is the Semantic Layer, which abstracts away much of the complexity
associated with introducing a new tool. The first step is to register your event data with Asemic’s User Action Catalog.
Whether your data is organized in multiple event tables or consolidated in one large table, the Semantic Layer
standardizes and organizes it into a structure optimized for analysis. Once the event data is registered, basic set of
metrics are automatically generated and ready for use.

This streamlined process minimizes the need for custom data modeling or complex transformations, ensuring that your data
is accessible and actionable as quickly as possible.

## Immediate Availability of Metrics

Adding new metrics is also straightforward and streamlined. When a new metric is defined, it’s immediately available for
querying, empowering your team to iterate quickly on dashboards and reports. The only exception is lifetime metrics,
which require a one-time recalculation before becoming fully available. However, even this process is automated and
designed for speed.

## Rapid Onboarding: Value Within a Day, Insights Within a Week

The entire data integration process with Asemic can be completed in less than a day. From registering your event data to
generating initial metrics, you’ll be set up and ready to explore your product data within hours. Within a week, your
team can begin deriving value from dashboards, reports, and deeper analyses, making data-driven decisions faster than
ever before.

This rapid onboarding process is perfect for teams that need quick wins and actionable insights without getting bogged
down in lengthy implementations. Whether you’re optimizing user journeys, analyzing feature performance, or tracking key
business metrics, Asemic’s integration ensures you hit the ground running.
